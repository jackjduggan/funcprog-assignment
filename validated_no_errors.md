### Full Title:
- Electronic Engineering Project Specification

### Short Title:
- Electronic Eng Proj Spec

### Credits:
- 5

### Level:
- Advanced

### Aim:
- The aim of the final year project subject is to augment the theoretical material, covered in the course, by exposing the student to circuit design and software development in a work laboratory environment. The benefits derived from co-operating with industry are recognised and where possible industrial based projects will be considered for assigning as student projects. In this semester, the students are encouraged to follow safe systems and working practices and to apply appropriate management techniques (personal and institute resource management, deciding achievable goals and sticking to them, etc.) and to develop their knowledge of the chosen topic, by performing literature and Internet searches and interviewing appropriate staff.

### Department:
- Engineering Technology

### Indicative Content:
- Projects are selected in collaboration with industry, based on research themes carried out by researchers at postgraduate level, in collaboration with other academic institutions and on occasion at the suggestion of the student themselves.
Literature Research (Periodicals, IEEE search engines, Internet)
Project Management (appraise the problem, break into constituent parts, identify milestones, based on time, difficulty, other resources available and overall ability to achieve the goals)
Early Milestones
Presentation through seminar / report on progress

### Learning Outcomes:
- Perform a thorough literature search including on-line scientific engineering databases, in a given area and compile the salient expressions, synopses, alternative techniques and their own proposed approach
Write realistic goals, based on available resources, difficulty of tasks and required learning/existing abilities for the milestones required to finally complete a project
Defend a proposed course of action, based on rational reasoning, resources and abilities
Present a project context, status quo and projected outcome to peers and staff in an open forum/seminar
Organise component orders, within the project budget and complying with the Institute's process for placing orders and recognising suppliers.
Develop and maintain a professional relationship with the supervisor and maintain a log of meetings

### Code:
- A05133

### Full Title:
- Electronic Engineering Project Implementation

### Short Title:
- Elec Eng Proj Implementation

### Credits:
- 10

### Level:
- Advanced

### Aim:
- This module follows on from Project Specification described in the previous semester outline. The student has thus already identified the particular challenges to be overcome and milestones to be achieved in this semester. Because the background work has already been covered through the literature research and the early project efforts, this semester should produce significant advances in terms of attaining the final goal. The work is then faithfully represented in a thesis, which shall include an accurate and concise description of the context, the challenge, the solution and the result of the particular problem posed. All work shall be the student's unless specifically stated otherwise through citation.
